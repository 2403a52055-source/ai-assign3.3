        "3.  **Reading Lines:** `f.readlines()` reads all the lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file (including the newline character at the end).\n",
        "4.  **Counting Lines:** `len(lines)` calculates the number of elements in the list of lines, which corresponds to the total number of lines in the file.\n",
        "5.  **Return Value:** The function returns the calculated number of lines. In case of a `FileNotFoundError` or any other exception, it prints an error message and returns 0.\n",
        "6.  **Examples (Commented Out):** The code includes commented-out examples showing how to create dummy text files and how to call the `count_lines_in_file` function to test it."
